  <h1>Project: Automation</h1>

  <p>This project provides an extension, so to speak, to several automation frameworks.</p>
  <p>It grants the developer with boilerplates and all the necessary tools,</p>
  <p>to quickly forge test cases or even executing repetitive tasks.</p>
  <p>It uses the power of <strong>Selenium</strong> to automate the Browser and Web applications;</p>
  <p><strong>Appium</strong> to automate Mobile Devices and Android based Smart TVs;</p>
  <p><strong>SikuliX</strong> and <strong>Robot</strong> to automate the computer through user input simulation</p>
  <p>and thorugh image recognition.</p>
  <br>
  <p>Web applications running in Smart TVs such as LG and Samsung, could be manipulated by hooking <a href="https://people.apache.org/~pmuellr/weinre/docs/latest/Home.html">Weinre</a></p>
  <p>into the .html file(s) and executing Javascript directly into the console.</p>
  <p>Though, this doesn't serve much purpose for testing, since there is no way to</p>
  <p>get to know the current state of the app</p>
